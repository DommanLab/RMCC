# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY?c=emerging_lineage&d=tree&f_division=Wyoming&p=full)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility.

# [VOCs in Wyoming](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in Wyoming.

The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) has risen the most dramatically in frequency, mirroring national trends. In May 2021, Alpha made up about 63% of Wyoming sequences.
Increased transmissibility fueled the spread of Alpha, but vaccines remain effective against this variant.

As of May 2021, an additional 20% of sequences came from other VOCs or variants of interest (VOIs). VOCs Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427 & B.1.249) and VOIs Iota (B.1.526) and B.1.617 have been reported in Wyoming in recent weeks.

# [B.1.617 Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY?c=emerging_lineage&d=tree&label=clade:21A&p=full&r=division&tl=division)

The B.1.617 variant was first reported in India in February 2021. It is currently classified as a variant of interest (VOI) by the CDC
based on potential reductions in the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments against this variant.

This phylogeny shows evidence of multiple introductions of B.1.617 to Wyoming, as well as evidence of community transmission.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between Wyoming and nearby states, including Colorado, Montana, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for March through May of 2021.
