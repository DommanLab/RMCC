# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY?c=emerging_lineage&d=tree&f_division=Wyoming&p=full)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility.

# [VOCs in Wyoming](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in Wyoming.

The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) has risen the most dramatically in frequency, mirroring national trends. In June 2021, Alpha makes up about 67% of Wyoming sequences. Increased transmissibility fueled the spread of Alpha, but vaccines remain effective against this variant.

In recent weeks, the frequency of Delta (B.1.617.2) has been increasing. Delta currently makes up about 14% of Wyoming sequences.

As of June 2021, an additional 20% of sequences came from other VOCs or variants of interest (VOIs). VOCs Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427 & B.1.249) and VOIs Iota (B.1.526) have been reported in Wyoming in recent weeks.

# [Delta (B.1.617.2) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

The B.1.617.2 variant was first reported in India in February 2021. It is currently classified as a variant of interest (VOI) by the CDC
based on potential reductions in the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments against this variant.

As of June 16, 2021, this data set includes 20 Delta sequences from Wyoming. This phylogeny shows evidence of multiple introductions of Delta to Wyoming, as well as evidence of community transmission.

# [Gamma (P.1) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

Gamma sequences have been reported in Wyoming since March 2021. Gamma has reduced susceptibility to some monoclonal antibody treatments. 
This phylogeny shows evidence of community transmission of Gamma in Wyoming.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between Wyoming and nearby states, including Colorado, Montana, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for March through May of 2021.
