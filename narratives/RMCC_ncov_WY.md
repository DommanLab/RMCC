# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility.

# [VOCs in Wyoming](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in Wyoming.

In early 2021, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) began rising in frequency in Wyoming and across the USA. Alpha was the dominant variant in Wyoming until the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, green) began spreading in the spring of 2021. The Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha and other variants, which allowed Delta to quickly outcompete other strains. Currently, almost all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Wyoming are caused by the Delta variant.

# [Delta (B.1.617.2) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Nearly all recent sequences from Wyoming have been identified as Delta. This phylogeny shows evidence of multiple introductions of Delta to Wyoming, as well as evidence of community transmission.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/WY)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between Wyoming and nearby states, including Colorado, Montana, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for May through August of 2021.
