# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@NM_narrative/ncov/NM?c=emerging_lineage&d=tree&f_division=New%20Mexico&p=full)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility.

# [VOCs in New Mexico](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@NM_narrative/ncov/NM)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in New Mexico.

The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) has risen the most dramatically in frequency, mirroring national trends. In May 2021, Alpha made up about 65% of New Mexico sequences.
Increased transmissibility fueled the spread of Alpha, but vaccines remain effective against this variant.

VOCs Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427 & B.1.249) and variant of interest (VOI) Iota (B.1.526) are currently found at low frequencies in New Mexico.

Several Alpha sequences have been reported in New Mexico since March 2021. Gamma has reduced susceptibility to some monoclonal antibody treatments. 
The phylogeny shows evidence of community transmission of Gamma in New Mexico.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@NM_narrative/ncov/NM)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between New Mexico and neighboring states, including Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for March through May of 2021.
