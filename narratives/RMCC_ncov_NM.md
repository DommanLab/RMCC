# [Emerging Lineages](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

Beginning in fall 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in New Mexico.

The variant B.1.1.7 (blue) has risen the most dramatically in frequency, mirroring national trends. In May 2021, B.1.1.7 made up about 65% of New Mexico sequences.
Increased transmissibility fueled the spread of B.1.1.7, but vaccines remain effective against this variant.

Variants P.1, B.1.526, B.1.427 & B.1.249 are currently found at low frequencies in New Mexico.

Multiple variants of concern (VOCs) have arisen independently from one another. Lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have acquired mutations that increase viral fitness, such as increased transmissibility.
