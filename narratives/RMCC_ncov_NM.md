# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM?c=emerging_lineage&d=tree&f_division=New%20Mexico&p=full)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility. hello

# [VOCs in New Mexico](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in New Mexico.

In recent weeks, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, green) has been reported in New Mexico. As of July 7, 2021, 31 Delta sequences have been reported. The prevalence of Delta sequences in New Mexico remains lower than in neighboring states. Increased transmissibility has fueled the spread of Delta, and the prevalence of this variant is likely to continue increasing.

Previously, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) had risen the dramatically in frequency and came to dominate New Mexico sequences. In May 2021, Alpha made up about 65% of New Mexico sequences. Alpha continues to make up the majority of New Mexico sequences, even as Delta spreads nationally.

VOCs Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427 & B.1.249) and variant of interest (VOI) Iota (B.1.526) are currently found at low frequencies in New Mexico.

# [Gamma (P.1) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM)

Our data set includes 32 Gamma (P.1) sequences from New Mexico. Gamma has been reported in New Mexico since March 2021. 
Gamma has reduced susceptibility to some monoclonal antibody treatments. This phylogeny suggests that P.1 has been introduced to New Mexico
multiple times, and it also shows evidence of community transmission of Gamma in New Mexico.

# [B.1.1.318 Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM)

Our Nextstrain build includes 21 New Mexico sequences identified as B.1.1.318. The earliest B.1.1.318 isolate in New Mexico was collected April 6, 2021. The strains in this tree cluster with sequences from Gabon, with evidence of community transmission in New Mexico. B.1.1.318 is not currently classified as a VOC, but it contains the E484K mutation, which can reduce the efficacy of monoclonal antibody treatments.

# [Delta (B.1.617.2) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM)

Our Nextstrain build includes 31 New Mexico sequences identified as Delta. The earliest Delta isolate in New Mexico was collected May 3, 2021. Many of the New Mexico Delta isolates cluster with those from neighboring states like Texas and Colorado.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC@narrative_CVO/ncov/NM)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between New Mexico and neighboring states, including Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for March through May of 2021.
