# [Variants of Concern](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it acquires mutations. Some of these mutations confer traits that benefit the virus, such as increased transmissibility. 
These beneficial mutations increase viral fitness and give the virus variant an evolutionary advantage.

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can also influence viral traits important to human health. 
When there is evidence that a variant is associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or impacts the success of treatments, vaccines, or diagnostics, it may be categorized as a variant of concern (VOC).

Multiple VOCs have emerged independently from one another. This means that lineages from different clades (branches on the tree) have independently acquired mutations affecting important traits like transmissibility.

# [VOCs in New Mexico](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

Beginning in the fall of 2020, variants of concern (VOCs) have been increasing in frequency in New Mexico.

In early 2021, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, blue) began rising in frequency in New Mexico and across the USA. Alpha was the dominant variant in New Mexico until the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, green) began spreading in the spring of 2021. The Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha and other variants, which allowed Delta to quickly outcompete other strains. Currently, almost all SARS-CoV-2 infections in New Mexico are caused by the Delta variant.

# [Delta (B.1.617.2) Lineage](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

Nearly all recent sequences from New Mexico have been identified as Delta. The earliest Delta isolate in New Mexico was collected May 3, 2021. The phylogeny shows evidence of Delta transmission between New Mexico and neighboring states, all well as transmission within New Mexico.

# [Transmission](https://nextstrain.org/community/DommanLab/RMCC/ncov/NM)

Unsurprisingly, the sequencing data show evidence of transmission between New Mexico and neighboring states, including Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and California.

This plot shows transmission data for May through August of 2021.
